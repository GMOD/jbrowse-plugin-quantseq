# jbrowse-plugin-quantseq

This is an external plugin for the [JBrowse 2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/)
open-source platform for visualizing and integrating biological data.
This plugin implements a QuantitativeSequence (quantseq) track type. It builds on the concept of a "dynamic sequence (dynseq)" track that was added to the
awesome [WashU Epigenome Browser](http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/).

This track combines the QuantitativeTrack and the ReferenceSequenceTrack from
JBrowse 2 in order to visualize quantitative data for regulatory genomics at
base-resolution, such as the predictions of the [BPNet](https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet) model. Here is what this new track looks like:
